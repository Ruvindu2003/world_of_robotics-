    <p id =>Robotics is an interdisciplinary field that merges engineering, computer science, and technology to create
        machines
        capable Of performing various tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. These robots are
        Often programmed to perform specific tasks, such as assembling products on a factory line, assisting in
        surgeries,
        or even exploring distant planets. Robotics has opened new possibilities for industries,
        healthcare, exploration, and personal use, leading to innovation In sectors that previously relied heavily on
        manual
        labor.</p>
    <p id="p"> In recent years, advancements in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies have greatly
        enhanced the capabilities Of robots. They are no longer just machines following preset
        instructions, but autonomous systems capable of learning, adapting, and interacting with their environment. From
        robotic arms in manufacturing to drones in agriculture, the world of robotics is rapidly evolving
        and has become a critical part of modern society.</p>

            <h3>Humanoid Robots: Overview of Humanoid Robots and Their Capabilities </h3>

            <p>Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble and mimic human behavior, both in appearance and
                functionality. These robots are capable of performing tasks traditionally reserved for humans, such as
                assisting in healthcare, customer service, and education. The defining characteristic of humanoid robots
                is their ability to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way, using advanced algorithms for
                speech recognition, facial expression interpretation, and decision-making.</p>

            <p>Some Of the most well-known humanoid robots include robots like ASIMO, Sophia, and Atlas, which have been
                designed for various purposes, from assisting the elderly and disabled to performing dangerous
                tasks in disaster-stricken areas. Humanoid robots are also becoming an integral part Of research and
                development, where they help scientists better understand human cognition, biomechanics, and social
                interaction. With continued advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics, humanoid robots are
                expected to become more autonomous, capable of learning from experience, and performing increasingly
                complex tasks in the future. </p>
